 *  [GroupState] ---|> [State]
 *  A GroupState can contain multiple other States. The States attached to a Node's GroupState
 *  behave like as if they were directly attached to the Node.
 *
 *  \note GroupStates support to be enabled in a nested way (e.g. on an inner Node and on a leaf Node on the same subtree),
 *		though this behvior is strongly not encouraged, as the contained States are not guaranteed to work in a nested way.
 *  \note the interface is intentionally designed as close as possible to the state related functions of Node.
 *		If the corresponding interface of Node is altered, these changes should also be performed to GroupState.
