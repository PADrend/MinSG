/**
 * color cube renderer, which is based on color-cube rendering approach. Its implementation here slightly differs from
 * that described in the paper (see below). Moreover any scene graph (Node) can be rendered with our color cube
 * renderer, because our implementation  uses  nodes' absolute bounding boxes as their color cubes
 * (this requires a different processing approach for inner nodes, see ColorCube.cpp for more details).
 *
 * 1. Before the subtree is displayed, nodes whose projection on the screen is smaller than the specified size
 *    (maximumProjSize) are collected to a priority queue (sorted in back-to-front order). Besides they are set
 *    inactive, so their subtrees cannot be displayed as geometry.
 *
 * 2. Next the subtree (of the node containing the color cube renderer) is displayed in common way (with exception
 *    of deactivated nodes and their subtrees).
 *
 * 3. Finally the nodes from the priority queue are displayed as color cubes and set active again.
 *
 * @note the various lighting states (LightingState) or shader (ShaderState) should be enabled before current
 * ColorCubeRenderer, otherwise the drawing of color cubes will ignore those lights and shaders enabled after current
 * ColorCubeRenderer.
